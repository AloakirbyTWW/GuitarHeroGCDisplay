[Download the latest NintendoSpy release here.](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy/releases/latest)  It contains the desktop viewer software as well as the Arduino firmware.  For help setting up the hardware, take a look at the guides here:

[EvilAsh25's SNES hardware building guide](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy/blob/master/docs/guide-evilash25.md)

[Gamecube hardware tutorial](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy/blob/master/docs/tutorial-gamecube.md)

[N64 hardware tutorial](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy/blob/master/docs/tutorial-n64.md)

**TODO** The wiring diagram is outdated!  It's missing the NES/SNES clock pin.  Should move the wiring diagram in to the tutorials as well anyway.
